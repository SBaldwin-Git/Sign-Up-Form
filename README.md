# Sign-Up-Form

Created using:

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript

# Learning Outcomes

- Advanced CSS
- Forms
- Accessibility

# The Odin Project

I created this website as part of The Odin Project Fullstack JavaScript course in order to learn about the use of advanced CSS in website development, this includes the use of forms and smaller features related to accessibility.
My hope is that those that view this page and my other projects as part of this course can get an idea of my programming knowledge. These projects will help to catalogue my own journey into Fullstack JavaScript development.
